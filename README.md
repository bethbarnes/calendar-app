* Users can view all of their events
* Users can select a day, and add an event to that day

## :hammer_and_pick: Built With

The frontend was built using modular React components and styled with CSS. I used React-Redux to manage state, and built the backend using Express.JS, Sequelize and PostgreSQL. I deployed the app using heroku.

I used [BoilerMaker](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/boilermaker), a boilerplate from Fullstack Academy as a boilerplate for this project. It includes basic front end and back end libraries, authentication, and project scaffolding, with little to no functionality. I added all the functionality, models, api routes and other features required in the specs.
