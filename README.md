#  Calendar

An online calendar app

## :spiral_calendar: Functionality

* Calendar renders dynamically, based on the month
* Users can view a calendar with their events for that month
* Users can select a day, and add an event to that day
* Users can edit or delete their events

## :hammer_and_pick: Built With

The frontend was built using modular React components and styled with CSS. I used React-Redux to manage state, and built the backend using Express.JS, Sequelize and PostgreSQL. I deployed the app using heroku.
